# Factorio-Crude-Artillery-Ship-Graphics
Graphics for the Crude Artillery Ship mod.


Made for a playthrough by JD-Plays as a simple and crude artillery ship. There are no plans to update this mod and it is provided entirely as-is.

Based on a fork of the Cargo Ships Graphics mod, version 0.1.0. As needed to modify the dependency list to allow use of the main Crude Artillery Ship mod.
